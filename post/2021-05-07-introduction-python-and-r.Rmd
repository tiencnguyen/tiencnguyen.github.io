Hey friends.

Today, I wanted to talk about two coding languages I learned in my Computational Biology course in Spring 2021.

## R
The first language I learned was R, which I had past familiarity with. R is useful for data analysis and working with large data sets. I actually use R frequently in my research lab where we study gut and vaginal microbiomes. You can check out two projects I did using R, under "Projects" in the navigation bar.

## Python

The second language I learned was python. I learned how to do basic functions with python such as indexing and slicing, as seen below.

```{python}
list1=[2,4,6,8,10]
list2=['a','b','c','d', 'e']
list1[-2] #second to last element

plist=list(range(20))
plist
plist[::-5] #Grab every fifth element in reverse
```

I also learned how to create loops using python.

```{python}
#loop with an index
mylist = ['dog', 'cat', 'bunny', 'frog', 'turtle', 'bird', 'mouse']
for i in range(len(mylist)):
    print(mylist[i])
```

```{python}
#loop over a string
for letter in "hi my name is tien":
    print(letter)
```

I also learned how to read in datasets, view them and analyze them using python. Below, I used the figure skating dataset from my Project 1.

```{R}
library(reticulate)
```

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
skate=pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BuzzFeedNews/2018-02-olympic-figure-skating-analysis/master/data/judged-aspects.csv",index_col=0)
skate.head()
skate.shape

skate["goe"] > 2
```

Finally, I used the reticulate package in R to demonstrate how python and R can talk to each other and share information across code chunks.

By using alternating R and python code chunks, I created a joke exchange between the two. This is a more simple use of reticulate and much more complex things can be done using a combination of R and python. Regardless, please enjoy!

```{R}
library(reticulate)
hi <- "Good"
```

```{python}
hi="afternoon!"
print(r.hi, hi)
```

```{R}
cat(c(hi,py$hi))
knock <- "knock"
```
```{python}
knock = "knock"
print(r.knock, knock)
who = "who's there?"
```

```{R}
cat(c(py$who))
python <- "python"
```

```{python}
python = "python"
print(r.python)
snake = "ah! a snake!"
```

```{R}
cat(c(py$snake))
```
