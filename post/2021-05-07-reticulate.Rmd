I used the reticulate package in R to demonstrate how python and R can talk to each other and share information across code chunks.

By using alternation R and python code chunks, I created a joke exchange between the two. This is a more simple use of reticulate and much more complex things can be done using a combination of R and python. Regardless, please enjoy!

```{R}
library(reticulate)
hi <- "Good"
```

```{python}
hi="afternoon!"
print(r.hi, hi)
```

```{R}
cat(c(hi,py$hi))
knock <- "knock"
```
```{python}
knock = "knock"
print(r.knock, knock)
who = "who's there?"
```

```{R}
cat(c(py$who))
python <- "python"
```

```{python}
python = "python"
print(r.python)
snake = "ah! a snake!"
```

```{R}
cat(c(py$snake))
```
